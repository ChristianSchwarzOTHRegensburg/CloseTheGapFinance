# News Analysis 

News Analysis is a Wordcloud Generator which you can use to get the latest Information about a specific Stock (or whatever youÂ´re interested in)

The Basic Version (News Analysis.py) has a hardcoded Search String (currently "WTI Price") just change this to whatever you like

The second Version (News Analysis V2.py) comes with a basic GUI where you can enter Search Strings

Both Version generate a Wordcloud from Headlines found on the first Page of Google for a particular Search String

Upcomming Versions should be able to identify if a word is positive or negative and color the Cloud accordingly. 

You are welcome to play around with this Project (there are a lot of Options for the Wordcloud, like showing it in a specific shape).
