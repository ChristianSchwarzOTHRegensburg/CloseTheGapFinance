# CloseTheGapFinance

Close the Gap is an e-book project (currently not yet published) that is about turning theoretical programming knowledge into practical projects. In Close the Gap - Finance these projects will mainly focus on financial topics.

Planned topics are among others:
- Wordcloud Generator for Stock Information (Generate Wordclouds from Newspaper Headlines to get an Overview what is moving a particular stock)
- Stock comparison (plot two or more stocks in one graph to see which one is performing better)
- Implement your own Magic Formula (based on Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula: get Stock Information and rank them to identify best investment opportunities) 
- Further projects can be added, the final e-book should contain about 10 projects

Suggestions for further projects are welcome, these should be realizable in about 100-200 lines of code. Each project starts with a basic version that contains the absolute minimum functionality to show the feasibility of the solution. In 3 -4 further steps the basic solution is then improved and additional functionality is added.

The E-Book should be available free of charge. If you want to participate in the project, please contact me :)
